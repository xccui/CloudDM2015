<h4>Workshop Overview</h4>
<p>Cloud computing has emerged as a promising computing and business model. By providing on-demand scaling capabilities without any large upfront investment or long-term commitment, it is attracting a wide range of users. The database community has also shown great interest in exploiting this new platform for data management services in a highly scalable and cost-efficient manner. Cloud computing presents challenges and opportunities for data management. The Cloud Data Management (CloudDM) workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners in cloud computing and data management systems together to discuss the research issues at the intersection of those areas, share experiences building and managing cloud-scale data management services, and also to draw more attention from the larger data management research community to this highly promising field.</p>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>After the great success of the first edition of the DMC workshop in 2012, IEEE TCDE formed a Working Group, Data Management in Cloud and decided to make the DMC workshop an integral part of IEEE ICDE conference. Concurrently, the CloudDB workshop series has been held successfully five times in conjunction with CIKM in the past and last year marked the first time the workshop came together with the prestigious ICDE conference. Given the overlap in the focus and scope of the DMC and the CloudDB workshops, the steering committees of the two workshops in consultation with TCDE members agreed to combine the efforts to propose the workshop on Cloud Data Management (CloudDM) â€“ Joint Workshop of Data Management in the Cloud (DMC) and CloudDB.</p>
