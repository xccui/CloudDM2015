<p>Title: <i>Incremental vs Rewrite from Scratch - a Biased Guide to Building a Web-scale OLTP Service</i><br/>
Slides: <a href="files/mark.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a></p>
<p>
Abstract: Many OLTP deployments in the web-scale industry start with a single-node open-source DBMS, add automation to manage many instances of the DBMS and then work with an open-source community to make things better via a large number of small improvements. The end result is far from perfect but frequently good enough to allow a business to focus on something other than the DBMS. The result is also frequently misunderstood by members of the DBMS community from academia and industry. I have been part of the incremental webscale DBMS effort for almost 10 years and think there is much to be gained by reducing this misunderstanding. We have interesting data management problems but are often far removed from our peers in industry and academia. In this talk I will explain why we used the incremental approach, where it has thrived and failed, and our priorities when considering new solutions.

His current focus at Facebook is the analysis and improvement of database algorithms and storage systems for small data (OLTP) workloads. He also works with WebScaleSQL and RocksDB to make MySQL and MongoDB better. Prior to his web-scale work he spent many years working on RDBMS internals at Oracle and Informix. He invented and implemented a very fast general purpose sort algorithm for the Oracle RDBMS. He has an MS in CS from UW-Madison.

<p>Title: <i>
The Service Contract Between Cloud Provider and Consumer: Consistency Properties</i></p>
<p>
Abstract: There is a wide diversity of choices for a consumer who needs a data store to hold the information for a cloud-hosted application.  Some	stores	are  run  as  services	by	the  cloud provider,  others  may  be  deployed  and  administered	directly  by the  cloud consumer  in  infrastructure  from	the  cloud	provider.  Some  stores  use  a  document  model,  others  are	relational,  or graph, or they may even offer just a key-value CRUD interface.	In this talk, we focus on the consistency properties. What can the consumer  be  confident	of,  when  several	operations	are performed on the same data? We aim to help the consumer make some sense of the many alternatives from real systems and from research proposals.
